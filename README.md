# The-supplemented-files-of-Small-Insulator-Defects-Detection-for-UAV-assisted-Power-IoVT

The part data of the proposed Insulator super-resolution detection dataset (ISDD) in "Small Insulator Defects Detection based on Multi-scale Feature Interaction Transformer for UAV-assisted Power IoVT", and remaining data will be uploaded after the Chinese New Year. 
Importantly, the work-based application will be released in this repository. 
If you have any questions or are interested in future work, please contact the owner of repository or Dr. Wu (email: wjq11346@student.ubc.ca ; Phone: +1 (236) 965-1936; Mail address: Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of British Columbiaia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.), or other authors of the paper except for academician Leung. 
We look forward to your letter, Thanks you!

#Revised (Vancouver time 2024.03.06).
At the request of experts, we open source the current version of the original ISDD dataset (链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-DUkCzOn7joDpIq0G_n-4A 
提取码：jv8q). The original dataset includes 2100 high-resolution images. In addition, you can refer to Augment.py to implement data set expansion, and you can use Downsampling.py to implement image downsampling.
Thanks you!
